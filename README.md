# Air Canvas

Rhe project aims to develop a character recognition system using the EMNIST dataset that can
recognize handwritten English characters and numbers in real-time on the digital canvas of
Aircanvas software. The system will be able to recognize 62 different alphanumeric characters,
including 10 digits, 26 uppercase letters, and 26 lowercase letters. The system will also be able to
recognize characters of different sizes, styles, and orientations. In addition, the system will be
able to save images drawn on the digital canvas for later us

## Features

-   Finger Detection using Mediapipe
-   Allows writing on the board only when a single finger is open
-   Change marker color using buttons
-   Clear button to clear the board
-   Character Recognition using TensorFlow

## Reproducing the Work

1.  Install dependencies using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
2.  Run the project through `python3 aircanvas.py`
